# twitch-jukebox

This project connects a [cmus](https://cmus.github.io/) music player to twitch chat. The player can be paused, stopped, started, move to the next song, and have songs added to it from twitch chat using the provided commands.

You can see a demonstration of the application in [this twitch clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/TenaciousScrumptiousSharkArsonNoSexy-YF-5SUVbll-HN-yr).

The CMUS player runs on a Lubuntu virtual machine. Uses cmus v2.8.0
